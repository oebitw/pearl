## Vision:

To provide quality services that exceeds the expectations of our esteemed women customers.



## Problem Domain

Many women see the automotive industry as an old boys’ club where they are treated as an easy mark not acknowledged as a decision maker.

With just 7% of frontline management, sales and service adviser positions currently occupied by women, it’s easy to see why **female shoppers** might feel their voice and perspective aren’t represented at the dealership.

Market research published by Road and Travel magazine revealed that women around the world buy more than 65% of all new cars and 53% of used cars, and they represent a critical influence in 93% of all car purchases, which are certainly huge numbers.

Projecting these numbers on the Saudi market will give us a clear indication of the importance of this customer segment.

**As a Solution** I decided to develop a special section on our website with an innovative new buying experience specially designed for ladies, focused to make women feel they are valuable customers for us and the car industry is not focused on men only.


## Understanding women buying mentality

When it comes to cars, it is commonly known that women do not understand anything in the “complex” auto industry, and when choosing their cars, they rely on superficial impressions that are limited to interest in the modern car model, its attractive exterior and beautiful color, and they do not pay any attention to capabilities, fuel consumption, expenses and others. But is the above true?


CarBayer, a website that specializes in providing car buying guides and providing verified reviews from experts and owners, has published a research study that shows the difference between the different priorities and choices that men and women make when buying cars.

The study revealed that **women take a more pragmatic approach when buying their cars, as they focus on fuel economy and lower costs of services such as operation, insurance, maintenance, etc.**, in contrast to men who control their purchases of car model, beauty, performance and modern technologies.


By understanding the women mentality in buying a car now we are more confident to build our product.

In order to have contestant design and user experience for all the Syarah website sections

I want to declare that we will
 features will be build on top of Syarah website.

### Search a car by it's image (Both)

I  want to follow a lean product development approach to build this feature with minimum waste.

The development will be in three phases based on the MVP testing results:


1) Start with MVP Explainer technique.
   -  we will build an animated video to market this feature for our customers and look for there feedback and comments.
   - Here we will collect qualitative data.

2)  Build a **Shadow button**.
     
     - We will build an element that let users upload a picture, when they upload it we will show them a greeting and thanking message for their interest in this feature, stating that the feature will be ready soon.

     - Here we will collect a quantitative data.

We will analyze the data and let's say the MVP test results were good.

3) We will start building the product.
     - Based on our large DB that contains millions of cars we will build an algorithm and use machine learning to identify the particular make, model, year, and body style of the car in the image.

     - We might use an external API in the begging like [carsxe](https://api.carsxe.com/what-car-is-that).
